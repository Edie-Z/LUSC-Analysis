# LUSC-Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of gene expression, clinical data, and miRNA data for **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)**. The data used for this project is sourced from publicly available datasets such as **TCGA** (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and **GEO** (Gene Expression Omnibus). The aim of this analysis is to explore the molecular characteristics of LUSC and identify potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapy.

## Project Overview

- **Gene Expression Analysis**: Identification of differentially expressed genes in LUSC samples.
- **Clinical Data**: Integration of clinical data with gene expression profiles to explore potential clinical outcomes and prognostic factors.
- **miRNA Analysis**: Investigating the role of miRNA in the regulation of gene expression and its association with LUSC.
- **Data Sources**:
  - **TCGA**: Cancer genomic data for LUSC patients.
  - **GEO**: Publicly available datasets for gene and miRNA expression.

## Objectives
1. Perform a comprehensive analysis of LUSC gene expression data.
2. Investigate the relationship between gene expression and clinical outcomes in LUSC.
3. Identify key miRNAs that may regulate gene expression in LUSC.
